abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while significantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while significantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on different features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets.},

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the role of electricity storage for the integration of high shares of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) in the long-term evolution of the power system. For this, a new electricity module is developed in POLES (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems). It now takes into account the impacts of VRES on the European power system. The power system operation relies on EUCAD (European Unit Commitment and Dispatch), which includes daily storage and other inter-temporal constraints. The innovative aspect of our work is the direct coupling between POLES and EUCAD, thus combining a long-term simulation horizon and a short-term approach for the power system operation. The storage technologies represented are pumped-hydro storage, lithium-ion batteries, adiabatic compressed air energy storage (a-CAES) and electric vehicles (charging optimisation and vehicle-to-grid). Demand response and European grid interconnections are also represented in order to include, to some extent, these flexibility options.},

abstract = {The design of transition pathways for sustainable electricity systems with high penetrations of renewable energy sources requires the use of energy modeling tools that are able to account for two key aspects: the evolution of fossil fuels and technology prices, and the natural dynamics of renewable resources. However, the modeling methodologies most currently used focus on only one of these two aspects, which hinders their suitability for performing long-term analysis with high penetrations of renewable energy sources. This paper presents a modeling framework that is able to optimize the investment in new renewable generation capacity on the long-term while taking into account the hourly dynamics of electricity supply and demand. The framework combines two of the most used energy planning tools, each able to account for one of the aspects of the modeling of energy systems. The framework was applied to continental Portugal for the time period of 2005-2050, in order to identify optimal investment plans in new renewable and fossil generation capacity with the goal of achieving significant CO2 emissions reduction, under different scenarios. The results show that the inclusion of dynamics in the modeling methodology can help avoid overinvestment and reduce the excess of electricity from renewable energy sources that cannot be used by the system. These results can have a significant impact on the design of a sustainable electricity system and may lead to a diversification of the energy sources used. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An increasing number of mitigation scenarios with deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions have focused on expanded use of demand-side electric technologies, including battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, and heat pumps. Here we review such "electricity scenarios" to explore commonalities and differences. Newer scenarios are produced by various interests, ranging from environmental organizations to industry to an international organization, and represent a variety of carbon-free power generation technologies on the supply side. The reviewed studies reveal that the electrification rate, defined here as the ratio of electricity to final energy demand, rises in baseline scenarios, and that its increase is accelerated under climate policy. The prospect of electrification differs from sector to sector, and is the most robust for the buildings sector. The degree of transport electrification differs among studies because of different treatment and assumptions about technology. Industry does not show an appreciable change in the electrification rate. Relative to a baseline scenario, an increase in the electrification rate often implies an increase in electricity demand but does not guarantee it. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable, fossil-free energy systems is interlinked with a high penetration of stochastic renewables, such as wind and solar. In this context, energy storage technologies of different kinds - namely electrical, thermal and chemical - are commonly expected to play a major role; however, this role is seldom quantified using whole energy system models. In this paper, our goal is to assess and quantify the role of these different storage technologies in low carbon energy systems. To do this, we apply EnergyScope TD, a novel open-source energy planning model, to the real case study of the national energy system of Switzerland; concretely, we optimise the Swiss energy system for a target future year with an hourly resolution. The results indicate the following trends: (i) Thermal storage in combination with heat pumping becomes the main source of flexibility in the electricity sector; (ii) electrification allows a high penetration of renewables in the transportation sector, and the remaining share of mobility is supplied by synthetic fuels; (iii) a mix of storage technologies is needed for different applications at different timescales, such as synthetic fuels for long-term and for mobility demand, and thermal storage for short term (day-week) and for heat demand. Overall, it emerges that storage technologies - such as thermal storage, vehicle to grid and synthetic fuel storage – can help decrease cost, decarbonise the mobility and heating sectors, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels.},

The survey includes demographic data on households, vehicles, people, and detailed information on daily travel by all modes of transportation. NHTS survey data is collected from a sample of households and expanded to provide national estimates of trips and miles of travel by travel mode, trip purpose, and other household attributes. When combined with historical data from the 1969, 1977, 1983,1990, and 1995 NPTS and the 2001 NHTS, the 2009 NHTS serves as a rich source of detailed travel data over time for users. This document highlights travel trends and commuting patterns in eight key areas - summary of travel and demographics, household travel, person travel, private vehicle travel, vehicle availability and usage, commute travel patterns, temporal distribution, and special populations. 17.},

abstract = {The Belgian energy system, in particular the electricity generation, is in full transition. To gain a better understanding of what the possible pathways are for this energy transition, Febeliec asked EnergyVille to develop an objective analysis of possible scenarios for electricity generation in Belgium for 2020-2030. The following questions are explored: 1) What will electricity generation in Belgium look like in 2020, taking into account current political decisions and in which the model choses the best economic options? 2) What will the Belgian electricity provision look like in 2020 and 2030, taking into account the most recent expert knowledge of technological options? 3) What impact will the possible political choices have on the related cost of the energy system transition? To get an accurate answer, the EnergyVille Belgium TIMES model, a techno-economic energy system model, is used to generate a set of scenarios in which assumptions on three sensitivity parameters, namely ‘the import capacity for electricity', ‘the fossil fuel prices' and ‘the phase out of nuclear energy' are being altered. Five scenarios are analysed:  Central Scenario: current trends on policies and global markets are kept;  10{\%} Import Restriction: electricity import is limited to 10{\%} of aggregated power generation;  Nuclear Extension: 10 year extension of 2 GW nuclear power capacity beyond 2025;  Low Fossil Fuel Price: assumes a low price level trend for fossil fuel prices;  High Fossil Fuel Price: assumes a high price level trend for fossil fuel prices. Central Scenario based on current trends on market and policies In 2016 55{\%} of the electricity generation in Belgium is provided by nuclear power plants and 14 {\%} by renewable energy sources. Based on the cost minimizing objective of the model, the results show that in 2030 electricity generation originates to an equal share from renewable sources and fossil fuel based installations. Wind onshore capacity grows from 1.5 to 8.6 GW, wind offshore from 0.712 to 2.2 GW and residential and commercial PV solar from 3.0 to 7.9 GW in the Central Scenario between 2016 and 2030. The natural gas based power plants and combined heat and power installations (CHPs) remain stable in capacity above 6 GW, but generation output increases from 24.3 TWh to 35.1 TWh by 2030. This generation mix exceeds the 13{\%} share of renewable energy generation in the final energy consumption as specified in the boundary conditions of the model for Belgium in the year 2030. The anticipated increase in net transfer capacity to neighbouring countries from 3.5 GW in 2014 to 6.5 GW is fully available in 2020 and results show electricity net imports of 15.6 TWh per year in 2030. With the closure of the nuclear plants and the increasing intermittent renewable production, electricity imports and gas plant based generation play a crucial role in the energy system. The two balance the growing and intermittent renewable generation output. In the Central Scenario, CO2 emissions in the electricity and heat producing sector increases by 25{\%} between 2016 and 2030 due to the increasing use of natural gas after the closure of the nuclear plants. Comparison of the sensitivity scenarios The results show a high level of variation in the amount of net electricity imports across scenarios, ranging from 6.2 TWh per year in the 10{\%} Import Restriction Scenario to 28.4 TWh in the High Fossil Fuel Price Scenario. The Nuclear Extension Scenario results show less natural gas based generation and less demand for natural gas based capacity compared to the Central Scenario. Investments in new gas plants (compared to the other scenarios) is in part delayed. From 2035 onwards, after the complete closure of the nuclear generation, other technologies will have to fill the gap. The variation among the overall system costs across scenarios is mainly driven by future natural gas price assumptions and electricity net import levels. Annualized investment costs in all five scenarios are stable with 1,818 to 1,974 M€ per year. The largest cost variation can be observed in the electricity import costs, ranging from 292 to 1,926 M€ per year followed by expenditures for fuels (mainly, but not exclusively natural gas), ranging from 1,259 to 2,678 M€. The overall costs for the power and heat generating system ranges from 4,800 to 6,400 M€ per year in 2030, with the Central Scenario marking the median spot at 6,180 M€. 5 The nuclear extension scenario and high fuel price scenario have lower CO2 emissions compare to the other sensitivity analysis. Under these boundary conditions the use of natural gas is to a large extent replaced by nuclear generation in the Nuclear Extension Scenario or avoided by electricity imports in the High Fuel price Scenario. This study provides facts and figures regarding technology choices and consequential impacts on the energy system as a whole. It does neither directly or indirectly predict electricity prices in general or for certain sectors. The scenario analysis with the Belgium TIMES model is based on a system cost optimization approach. It provides a technical and economic analysis framework to evaluate choices and resulting cost for the energy system of Belgium and can contribute valuable insights into consequences certain policy choices might have for the future.},

abstract = {In this report, different long-term evolutions of the Belgian future energy system are drafted, analysed and evaluated. All evolutions are designed to meet the requirement of a 100{\%} renewable based national energy system by 2050. For this purpose, a baseline is developed which depicts an energy system without the stringent renewables' requirement. Next, different trajectories are sketched that lead up to a 100{\%} renewable coverage in 2050. The trajectories show that it is feasible to combine economic growth and comfort with far going deployment of renewable energy sources, provided a number of key options and effective policies and measures are being implemented. These options were deducted from several discussions with stakeholders via an open dialogue process, as well as with national experts, and finally, were presented to the Steering committee. The analysis leads to the undeniable observation that drastic changes in a multitude of areas throughout society are required to obtain the desired level of renewable energy penetration in 2050, but also that such a transition can be realised through various sectoral, technology and inter-temporal choices. In other words, this study describes a vast number of different trajectories leading to a 100{\%} renewable energy system iin Belgium in the long term, as well as their socio-economic impacts.},

This report contains assessments of energy technology reference indicators (ETRI) and it is aimed at providing independent and upto-date cost and performance characteristics of the present and future European energy technology portfolio. It is meant to complement the Technology Map of SETIS. Combined these two reports provide:  techno-economic data projections for the modelling community and policy makers, e.g.: o capital and operating costs; o thermal efficiencies and technical lifetimes;  greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumptions;  an overview of the technology, markets, barriers and techno-economic performance;  a useful tool for policymakers for helping to identify future priorities for research, development and demonstration (RD{\&}D); The ETRI report covers the time frame 2010 to 2050. This first version of the report focuses on electricity generation technologies, but it also includes electrical transmission grids, energy storage systems, and heat pumps.},

  abstract = {Concerns related to climate change and security of energy supply are pushing various countries to make strategic energy planning decisions. This requires the development of energy models to aid decision-making. Large scale energy models are often very complex and use economic optimization to define energy strategies. Thus, they might be black-boxes to public decision-makers. This work aims at overcoming this issue by proposing a new modelling framework, designed to support decision-makers by improving their understanding of the energy system. The goal is to show the effect of the policy and investment decisions on final energy consumption, total cost and environmental impact.

The modelling approach and the model structure are described in detail. Final energy consumption is represented as the sum of three main components: heating, electricity and transportation. In this framework, a sequential modelling strategy allows the assessment of the competition between electricity and fuels in the heating and transportation sectors without increasing the model complexity. A monthly resolution is chosen in order to highlight seasonality issues of the energy system. Developed with the goal of being easily adaptable to any large-scale energy system, the modelling approach is currently implemented within an online energy calculator for the case of Switzerland.},

abstract = {Energy planning recently received more attention in Switzerland through the new strategy phasing out nuclear energy by 2034. Often however the energy planning is only done from the electrical side. Thiswork takes a different angel and helps communities and energy utilities planning tomorrows energy system from a heat based perspective. After the data collection and structuring, the methodology presented here designs an energy system. Based on the quality of the collected data, the approach to define the energy demand should be chosen. In order to reduce calculation time, a data reduction approach is developed to reduce the input data without loosing significant information and precision. In particular, the methodology focuses on the integration of a stochastic resource, in this case solar thermal heat production, in combination with thermal energy storage. The thermal energy storage can be used as a short or long termthermal energy storage. The framework compares design solutions for the two storage types considering either a total cost approach or a life cycle assessment approach using the cumulative exergy demand (CExD). The proposed mathematical programming framework is based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach, that canwork on different levels of detail between building to community or city level. The optimization problem can also be further simplified to a linear problem, increasing the size of problem that can be solvedwhile reducing or keeping a constant computation time. The discussed cases showan interest in further investigating storage solution using both, the short and long termstorage at once, because they allowto reduce the system's overall costs or CExD significantly. The framework is then extended to consider buildings as an energy storage. The building's internal temperature can be raised from 20 °C up to 23 °C, giving a comfort temperature range that can be used for storing heat. The integrating of both storage types, the thermal energy storage and the building as an energy storage, showno significant impact on the energy system design. However, costs or CExD can be reduced. In addition, the heat demand can be modified through the decision of optimal energy retrofitting strategy for a group of buildings. The framework decideswhich of the building to refurbish based the overall CExD including CExD used for retrofitting the building. Finally, a method is proposed to integrate uncertainty of the model's input parameters into the system design. A global sensitivity analysis evaluates the impact of each uncertain parameter onto the system, allowing to focusing on the outputs of interest. Robust optimization is applied with a simulation-based approach, the additional costs for a robust design are calculated, as well as the different unit sizes. The low complexity of the developed models allows for an easy integration of new data collected during the development of a project, which is often the case in urban energy planning applications.},

abstract = {Oil is traded in a market where uncertainty, price volatility, and sudden supply disruptions are common characteristics. Natural disasters, political disagreements and wars can seriously affect supply and demand, and consequently economic activity. One particularly powerful tool of IEA member countries to respond to such disruptions is emergency oil stocks. In its history the IEA released stocks on three occasions, reducing supply shortfalls and the associated economic damage. This paper is expected to provide a general guide to the existing emergency stockholding system for countries who are considering the introduction of new stockholding systems or changes to their existing emergency stocks. It highlights the overall gains associated with emergency stocks and outlines important considerations for the establishment of stocks. In order to assess the economic benefits derived from holding emergency stocks this paper proceeds in four steps. First, it quantifies the costs involved in holding emergency stocks. Second, it assesses the benefits associated with holding emergency stocks. Third, cost and benefits are compared in order to assess the net benefits associated with the emergency stocks. Forth, the paper outlines different ways of financing emergency stocks based on IEA countries' practices.},

abstract = {A novel efficient hydrogen liquefaction process is introduced and analyzed. Two independent refrigeration cycles with different mixed refrigerants (MR) are used in the process which can produce 300 tons liquid hydrogen per day. The proposed process liquefies a feed of 3.450 kg s−1 normal hydrogen gaseous at 25 °C and 21 bar to equilibrium temperature (−195 °C) by the first refrigeration cycle with power consumption of 1.102 kWh/kgLH2. In the second refrigeration cycle, the hydrogen is cooled to −253 °C with power consumption of 3.258 kWh/kgLH2, enjoying the least total power consumption compared to the identical liquefaction plants. Thermal design of the heat exchangers and expanders at wide range of temperature and using innovative and appropriate mixed refrigerants according to the configuration are novel aspects of the proposed process. Also, composition of the first and second refrigeration cycles' refrigerants is another novelty of the proposed process. Energy and exergy analyses of the proposed process are investigated. The energy analysis reveals that coefficient of performance of the proposed process is 0.1797 which is considerably higher than the other identical processes. According to the results of the exergy analysis, exergy efficiency of the first refrigeration cycle, second refrigeration cycle and the whole liquefaction process are 67.53{\%}, 52.24{\%} and 55.47{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Fossil fuels depletion and increasing environmental impacts arising from their use call for seeking growing supplies from renewable and nuclear primary energy sources. However, it is necessary to simultaneously attend to both the electrical power needs and the specificities of the transport and industrial sector requirements. A major question posed by the shift away from traditional fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources lies in matching the power demand with the daily and seasonal oscillation and the intermittency of these natural energy fluxes. Huge energy storage requirements become necessary or otherwise the decline of the power factor of both the renewable and conventional generation would mean loss of resources. On the other hand, liquid and gaseous fuels, for which there is vast storage and distribution capacity available, appear essential to supply the transport sector for a very long time ahead, besides their domestic and industrial roles. Within this context, the present assessment suggests that proven technologies and sound tested principles are available to develop an integrated energy system, relying on synthetic fuels. These would incorporate carbon capture and utilization in a closed carbon cycle, progressively relying mostly on solar and/or nuclear primary sources, providing both electric power and gaseous/liquid hydrocarbon fuels, having ample storage capacity, and able to timely satisfy all forms of energy demand. The principles and means are already available to develop a carbon-neutral synthetic fuel economy.},

abstract = {We describe a process for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere in an industrial plant. The design captures ∼1 Mt-CO2/year in a continuous process using an aqueous KOH sorbent coupled to a calcium caustic recovery loop. We describe the design rationale, summarize performance of the major unit operations, and provide a capital cost breakdown developed with an independent consulting engineering firm. We report results from a pilot plant that provides data on performance of the major unit operations. We summarize the energy and material balance computed using an Aspen process simulation. When CO2 is delivered at 15 MPa, the design requires either 8.81 GJ of natural gas, or 5.25 GJ of gas and 366 kWhr of electricity, per ton of CO2 captured. Depending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs, the levelized cost per ton CO2 captured from the atmosphere ranges from 94 to 232 {\$}/t-CO2. An industrial process for large-scale capture of atmospheric CO2 (DAC) serves two roles. First, as a source of CO2 for making carbon-neutral hydrocarbon fuels, enabling carbon-free energy to be converted into high-energy-density fuels. Solar fuels, for example, may be produced at high-insolation low-cost locations from DAC-CO2 and electrolytic hydrogen using gas-to-liquids technology enabling decarbonization of difficult-to-electrify sectors such as aviation. And second, DAC with CO2 sequestration allows carbon removal. The feasibility of DAC has been disputed, in part, because publications have not provided sufficient engineering detail to allow independent evaluation of costs. We provide an engineering cost basis for a commercial DAC system for which all major components are either drawn from well-established commercial heritage or described in sufficient detail to allow assessment by third parties. This design reflects roughly 100 person-years of development by Carbon Engineering.

With the global population increase driving continued increases in fossil fuel use, humanity's primary reliance on fossil energy for the next several decades is assured. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the direct removal of CO2 from the air, or “direct air capture” (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration.

@article{Dupont2017,
abstract = {Looking ahead to 2050 many countries intend to utilise wind as a prominent energy source. Predicting a realistic maximum yield of onshore and offshore wind will play a key role in establishing what technology mix can be achieved, specifying investment needs and designing policy. Historically, studies of wind resources have however differed in their incorporation of physical limits, land availability and economic constraints, resulting in a wide range of harvesting potentials. To obtain a more reliable estimate, physical and economic limits must be taken into account. We use a grid-cell approach to assess the theoretical wind potential in all geographic locations by considering technological and land-use constraints. An analysis is then performed where the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) of the wind potential is evaluated. Finally, a top-down limitation on kinetic energy available in the atmospheric boundary layer is imposed. With these constraints wind farm designs are optimized in order to maximize the net energy flux. We find that the global wind potential is substantially lower than previously established when both physical limits and a high cut-off EROI {\textgreater} 10 is applied. Several countries' potentials are below what is needed according to 100{\%} renewable energy studies.},
