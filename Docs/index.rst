EnergyScope is developed by EPFL (Switzerland) and UCLouvain (Belgium).
This documentation introduces the *core* model EnergyScope with  performances details in the :doc:`/sections/Overview` section.
It has been applied to various countries and extended to face most of its limitations.
For more information on versions, applications, and acknowledgments, see the :doc:`/sections/Releases` section.

Downloading EnergyScope
=======================

The public version of EnergyScope can be downloaded in the Releases section or from its github repository (using the Clone or Download button on the right side of the screen): https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope
You might be interested by two different versions:

* `Open solver <https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope/tree/GLPK_latest>`_ : uses open-source solver and can directly be run, see `getting started with GLPK <https://energyscope.readthedocs.io/en/master/sections/Getting%20started.html>`_ .
* `Python wrapper <https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope/tree/EnergyScope.py>`_ : uses Python for pre/post processing and plotting. It supports ampl-cplex/gurobi solvers but can also work with open-source alternatives. See  `getting started with Python <https://energyscope.readthedocs.io/en/energyscope.py/sections/Getting%20started.html>`_
