Presolve eliminates 945074 constraints and 608029 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 6;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
319121 variables, all linear
585085 constraints, all linear; 1847596 nonzeros
	392930 equality constraints
	192155 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.
