Presolve eliminates 1115875 constraints and 705551 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 11;" might work better.
Adjusted problem:
238868 variables, all linear
440193 constraints, all linear; 1367475 nonzeros
	320434 equality constraints
	119759 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.

Setting $presolve_fixeps >= 5.06e-07 could change presolve results.
