Presolve eliminates 1041128 constraints and 665506 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 5;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
278913 variables, all linear
514942 constraints, all linear; 1586070 nonzeros
	355258 equality constraints
	159684 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 1 nonzero.

Setting $presolve_fixeps >= 1.65e-07 could change presolve results.
