# Content and documentation#
Modified version for course LMECA2675 at UCLouvain
This folder contains the third release (v2_1, hourly LP) of the EnergyScope model adapted to the Belgian case.  
More recent releases are available @ the EnergyScope project repository: https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope   
This version of the model is an extension of the one in [4].  
The data and formulation are available here:
	https://energyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
