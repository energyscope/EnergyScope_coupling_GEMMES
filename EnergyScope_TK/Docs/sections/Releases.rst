How to cite
===========

In the academic spirit of collaboration, the source code should be appropriately acknowledged in the resulting scientific disseminations.
You may cite it as follows:

* [1], for general reference to the EnergyScope project and the EnergyScope modeling framework
* [2], for reference to the origins of the EnergyScope project or to the first online version of the calculator energyscope.ch
* [3], for reference to the energyscope MILP modeling framework
* [4], for reference to the current code

You are welcome to report any bugs related to the code to the following:
